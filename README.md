Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam, a highly motivated data scientist with a strong aptitude for data analysis and a commitment to team success through diligent work, meticulous attention to detail, and exceptional organizational skills. I am currently working towards expanding my knowledge in Python and other cutting-edge technologies through various online bootcamps, and I am eager to leverage my expertise to drive innovation and contribute to organizational growth. My passion for data analysis and visualization, combined with my experience in accounting data analytics and technologies, positions me to be a valuable asset to any team. When I'm not diving deep into data, you can find me exploring the outdoors, watching my team, Newcastle United, or trying out the local beer scene. Let's connect and see how we can work together to make a positive impact! ðŸš€
